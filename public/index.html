            Twin indices on women’s empowerment and gender equality
          </h4>
          <p>
            This report expands the measures for women and girls to exercise
            their potential, their opportunities and the choices available to
            them. Policies that seek to further empower women and girls and
            achieve gender parity require robust data and measures that are
            comparable across countries and based on a sound methodology. While
            some such measures are available, the picture has been incomplete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report uses data for 114 countries, including new data on the
            progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals to fill some
            gaps. It introduces a new multidimensional framework to measure the
            status of women’s empowerment and gender equality across the world,
            with the Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender
            Parity Index (GGPI) as new twin indices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The WEI focuses solely on women, measuring their power and freedoms
            to make choices and seize opportunities in life. The GGPI evaluates
            the status of women relative to men in core dimensions of human
            development and exposes gaps in parity between women and men.
